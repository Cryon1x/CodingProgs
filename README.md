# CodingProgs 
This repo consists of two sample programs written in C: 

- A vacuum bot simulator with built-in location APIs.  

- A virtual shopping cart that parses strings describing purchases and produces a receipt.

In each file is a readme with documentation, unit testing, and the original source code. I've also included a compiled executable just in case. Note that I used gcc.
